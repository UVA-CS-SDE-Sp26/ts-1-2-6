All access to files and content of files is to be done through the command line.
Command line is connected to the FileHandler, so files can be requested and will be returned with the contents.

If program is executed with no arguments:
    - list of files is available is produced
    - all files will be numbered as such:
        01 filea.txt
        02 fileb.txt
        03 filec.txt

If program is executed with an argument:
    - if it's a valid argument, file content is retrieved and displayed in terminal
        - either argument is a number or the filename
        - if the argument is a number, it returns the file corresponding with that number
        - if the argument is a filename, it returns the file corresponding with that filename
    - else, returns message saying "Argument is invalid, please enter a valid filename"
