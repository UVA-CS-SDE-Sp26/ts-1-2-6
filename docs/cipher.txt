Cipher Class

The Cipher class reads a cipher key from a file named key.txt within a folder called ciphers.
The Cipher class validates the cipher key, builds a cipher map, and then deciphers the given string.

readCipherKeyFile():
    Reads the cipher key from ciphers/key.txt
    Validates that the cipher key is exactly two lines of equal length
    Throws an exception if the file cannot be read or is invalid

buildCipherMap():
    calls readCipherKeyFile() to get the validated key
    Assigns the first line to the actual letters and the second line to the ciphered letters
    Builds a map from ciphered characters to actual characters
    Stores the completed map in cipherMap

decipher():
    Throws an exception if the input string is null
    Turns the ciphered string into an array of characters in order to deal with each character/mapping individually
    Converts each valid character using cipherMap; leaves invalid characters unchanged
    Returns a deciphered string


Testing Cipher Class using CipherTest:

Testing was done using junit. Completed the following tests:
    testCipherConstructor(): Tested the constructor to see if the file was readable, key is valid, and if the cipher map was built
    testDecipher(): Tests if the decipher method correctly deciphers a string with known characters
    testDecipherWithUnknownCharacters(): Tests if the decipher method leaves unknown characters (not in the key file) as is. Tests both known and unknown characters.
    testDecipherWithEmptyString(): Tests if the decipher method properly deals with an empty string
    testDecipherWithNull(): Tests if the decipher method properly deals with a null value
    testDecipherWithNoValidCharacters(): Tests if a string with no valid characters is returned as is
