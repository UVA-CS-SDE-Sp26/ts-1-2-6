When the program is run with no arguments, it should list the numbered files available for display
eg:
01 filea.txt
02 fileb.txt
03 filec.txt

When the program is run with one argument, the program will do the following:
- check to ensure the argument is a valid file name
- print the contents of the file decrypted with the default key

When the program is run with two arguments, the program will do the following:
- check to ensure the first argument is a valid file name
- check to ensure the second argument is a valid decryption type
- print the contents of the file decrypted with the key specified in the second argument

* If the user enters a file name that is not a number, an error message will be displayed on the screen
* If the user enters a file name that does not exist, a message informing them that the file does not exist
will be displayed
* If the user enters an invalid decryption key name, a message informing them that the decryption key does not exist
will be displayed
