When the program requests a list of files, the FileHandler will do the following:

-Check that a folder named data/ exists in the project directory
-Retrieve all regular files located inside the data/ folder
-Return a list of filenames only (not full file paths)
-Sort the filenames alphabetically before returning them

This allows the user interface to display files in a consistent numbered format, such as:

01 filea.txt
02 fileb.txt
03 filec.txt

When the program requests the contents of a file, the FileHandler will do the following:

-Check that the provided filename is not null or empty
-Verify that the data/ directory exists and is accessible
-Ensure that the requested file exists inside the data/ directory
-Read and return the full contents of the file as a string


Error Handling

If a file-related error occurs, the FileHandler will throw a FileAccessException.

Errors are thrown in the following situations:

-The data/ directory does not exist
-The requested file does not exist
-The filename provided is null or blank
-An attempt is made to access a file outside of the data/ directory

Testing

The FileHandler is tested using unit tests written with JUnit 5.
Temporary directories are used during testing to avoid reliance on real project files.

Tests verify that:

-Files are listed in sorted order
-File contents are read correctly
-Missing directories and files are handled properly
-Path traversal attempts are blocked
